# Note: Siren Audio File

The app requires a siren audio file at `assets/siren.mp3` for the emergency alert sound feature.

Since audio files cannot be committed as text, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Download a Free Siren Sound
Visit these websites to download free siren/alarm sounds:
- https://freesound.org/ (search for "emergency siren" or "alarm")
- https://www.zapsplat.com/ (free sound effects)
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/ (free audio)

## Option 2: Disable Siren Feature
If you don't want the siren sound:
1. Open the app
2. Go to Settings
3. Turn off "Play Siren Sound"

## Option 3: Use a Simple Beep
You can replace the siren with device haptic feedback only by modifying:
`src/services/AlertService.js`

The app will still work without the audio file - it will just use vibration instead.

## How to Add the Audio File

1. Create an `assets` folder in the project root if it doesn't exist
2. Place your `siren.mp3` file inside the `assets` folder
3. The path should be: `emergency app/assets/siren.mp3`

That's it! The app will automatically load and play the siren when activated.
